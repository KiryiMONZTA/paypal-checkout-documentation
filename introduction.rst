For what?/Where not?
====================

Use :productname:`PayPal Checkout`,

* if you do not yet offer PayPal as a payment method in your OXID eShop
* if you already use PayPal but want to offer a wide range of popular payment methods, including purchase on invoice, especially to international customers

:productname:`PayPal Checkout` checks and confirms your payment request in real time. As a store owner you are therefore protected against payment failures.

You have the PayPal module?
---------------------------

Switch to :productname:`PayPal Checkout` to offer your customers additional payment methods including purchase on account,
which are popular in international markets.

However, note that in :productname:`PayPal Checkout` V. 1.0 there is no migration process yet to migrate open orders.



You have the PayPal PLUS module?
--------------------------------

The API of PayPal PLUS is outdated. PayPal does not develop the API and does not offer new contracts for it.

Switch to :productname:`PayPal Checkout` if it is important for you to offer your customers the quick purchase feature of :productname:`PayPal Checkout`.

This allows your customers to skip the registration process in your eShop and start ordering and paying directly on the product detail page, for example (see :ref:`configuration:Button placement settings`).

Note, however, that in :productname:`PayPal Checkout` V. 1.0 there is no migration process yet to migrate open orders.
