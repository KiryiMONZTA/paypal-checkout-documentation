.. ATTENTION::

   **No migration possible from PayPal or PayPal PLUS to PayPal Checkout**.

   You cannot migrate orders from the PayPal or PayPal PLUS modules to the PayPal Checkout module.

   Recommendation: Before moving to PayPal Checkout, wait until we have developed a version that migrates your orders.

   Not recommended: If you want to migrate from PayPal to the PayPal Checkout module right now, do the following:

      1. Test PayPal Checkout in a test system.
      2. Switch to PayPal Checkout when you are sure that there are no more open PayPal or PayPal PLUS orders in your production system.
